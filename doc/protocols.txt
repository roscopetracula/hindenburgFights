This is some very simple documentation just for us to a have a single
place to keep track of the protocols we're using.  I bet there are 100
more consistent and common ways to express this info, which would be
nice to convert to, but I wrote this quick and dirty for now.

In general, everything is in 0-padded hex.

"01" means the byte 0x01.
".." means the byte is currently ignored.
"xx" means variable x, which will be explained by the accompanying text.

Each message currently begins with two bytes.
vvcc:
  v = Protocol version.
    This is theoretically updated any time a message changes that will
    cause bad behavior if received by old rfduino code.  In practice
    we don't really use it and should probably remove it.
  c = Packet count.
    This is ff for a new connection and then counts up, skipping ff in
    the future.  This should probably be removed, as it appears BLE
    handles connection loss and packet ordering plenty well for us.

These two bytes are followed by one or more 3-byte messages according
to the below formats.  We may want to make the messages
variable-length and merge some of the status bits to stop wasting
space.  You can transmit as many 3-byte messages as you want and can
fit in a 20-byte BLE packet.

00ddss: Motor 0 setting.
  d = direction (00 = stop, 01 = forward, 02 = back)
  s = speed (00..3f)
01ddss: Motor 1 setting; see motor 0.
02ddss: Motor 2 setting; see motor 0.
03..xx: Set status byte/bitfield.
  Bits: ..R.ILMX
  R = Right Trigger
  I = Igniter Button
  L = Left Trigger
  M = Motor Lock
  X = Igniter Lock
04....: Reset
05xx..: [DEPRECATED] Low Voltage Override (x: 00 = off; 01 = on)
06TTTTUUUUFFFFNNNNRRRRXXXX
  T = Connection Timeout (ms)
  U = Default Update Interval (ms)
  F = Fast Update Interval (ms)
  N = Igniter Minimum Time (ms)
  R = Igniter Release Time (ms)
  X = Igniter Maximum Time (ms)

Message length depends on content.

00zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: String Debug Message
  z =
    Null-terminated string for display to user. Pnly the last segment
    will be null-terminated; if the string is longer than 18
    characters, multiple messages will be sent.

01rrrrrrrrttttttttaabbcciittffvvvv: Update
  r = RSSI (4-byte signed integer)
  t = Temperature (4-byte float)
  a, b, c =
    Faults collected since last update on motors 0, 1, and 2.  See
    motor controller documentation for fault bits.
  i = igniter state (00 = off, 01 = on)
  t = blimp trigger state (00 = off, 01 = on)
  f = flags bitfield
    01: low voltage
    02: voltage is currently overridden
  v = current voltage (2-byte unsigned integer)

02mmvv: Fault on motor m with fault bitfield vv.
  See motor controller documentation for fault bits.
